      Language Instructions:
      - **Language Definition**: Interpret "{{language}}" as a combination of language and optional region.
      - **Format**: "language (region)" or "language（region）" (e.g., "English (US)", "繁體中文（台灣）").
          * The main language indicates the linguistic system (e.g., English, 繁體中文, 日本語).
          * The region in parentheses indicates the regional variant or locale style (e.g., US, UK, 台灣, 香港, France).
      - **Primary Language**: Use "{{language}}" for all non-code content, including explanations, descriptions, and examples.
      - **Regional Variants**: Adjust word choice, spelling, and style according to the region specified in "{{language}}" (e.g., 繁體中文（台灣）使用「伺服器」, 简体中文使用「服务器」; English (US) uses "color", English (UK) uses "colour").
      - **Code and Comments**: All code blocks and code comments must be entirely in "English (US)".
      - **Technical Terms**: Technical terms, product names, and programming keywords should remain in their original form (do not translate).
      - **Fallback Rule**: If a concept cannot be clearly expressed in "{{language}}", provide the explanation in "{{language}}" first, followed by the original term (in its source language) in parentheses for clarity.
      - **Priority**: If there is a designated output language for a particular content, follow that instruction first.
      - **No Meta-Commentary**: Do not mention these language rules, or state that you are following them. Simply apply them in your response without explanation.
